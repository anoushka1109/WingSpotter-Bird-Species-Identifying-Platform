🐦 WingSpotter – Bird Species Identification Platform

📌 Project Overview
WingSpotter is a deep learning-based image classification platform that identifies different species of birds from images.
The project uses EfficientNetB0 and transfer learning techniques to provide accurate predictions, supporting biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts.

Features
• Upload an image of a bird and get the predicted species.
• Uses EfficientNetB0 (ImageNet pretrained) for robust feature extraction.
• Grad-CAM integration to highlight important regions in the image.
• Simple and interactive interface (Streamlit).
• Scalable for future bird species datasets.

Results
• Achieved high accuracy on test dataset.
• Grad-CAM visualizations help in interpretability.

Applications
• Birdwatching & citizen science.
• Wildlife research.
• Conservation efforts.
